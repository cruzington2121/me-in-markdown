## Introduction

Hello. My name is Jahn and I am in the 10th grade. My goal for the school year is to have at least straight B's, but straight A's would be preferred and better. My favorite movie is the recent F1 movie, starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris. My favorite show definitely has to be Suits because it teaches me a little bit about being a lawyer and what they do.

During my freetime, I like to play video games. If I am not playing video games, I usually work out and go to the gym or just lay in my bed and watch tiktok. I like playing NBA 2k25 a lot, and I also like playing other games like Roblox and Assassins Creed. I have finished 9/14 Assassins Creed games and I am still working on being able to finish all of them.

Three years ago, I traveled to Europe and visited the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, and France. It was an amazing experience because every country had something special to see and enjoy. The UK provided a lot of history, Switzerland provided beautiful mountains, Italy provided great pasta and paintings, and France provided tasty pastries and the Eiffel Tower. I liked tasting the food, as all the restaurants offered something different like Swiss chocolate, Italian pizza, and French croissants. I had lots of new foods and learned to enjoy new tastes. This experience taught me that there is a culture for each, and I have memories that I will never forget.
